<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Delivery Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-loop</li><li>Close-loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The insulin delivery pump market is primarily divided into two types: open-loop and closed-loop systems. Open-loop pumps require users to manually input insulin doses based on their blood glucose levels and meals, providing flexibility but necessitating careful monitoring. In contrast, closed-loop systems, also known as artificial pancreas systems, automatically adjust insulin delivery based on continuous glucose monitoring, offering more precise control and reducing the burden of manual inputs. Both systems aim to improve diabetes management and patient outcomes.</p></p>
